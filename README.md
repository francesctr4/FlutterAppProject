# Mobile Devices: P2 - Flutter App Project
## Guidelines

This task aims to make an entire application in Flutter using a web API. The task is in groups of 2 to 4 students.
The app must meet minimum requirements:

- It must use a web API.
- It must have as many usable screens as twice the number of party members (2 people = 4 screens, 3 people = 6 screens, etc.). A dialog box does not count as a screen.
- Must use Git and GitHub. Also, commits should be short (100 lines max). If you use ChatGPT or others and the code you generate is longer, you will need to make the changes to the project step by step.
  
If you want to confirm the scope and feasibility of the project, we can discuss it before we start.
